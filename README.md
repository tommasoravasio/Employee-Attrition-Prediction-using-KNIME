# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-using-KNIME

## Description
This project was developed for the Big Data & Databases course at Bocconi University and it focuses on predictive analysis of employee attrition using KNIME Analytics Platform. By implementing a structured KNIME workflow, we leverage machine learning techniques to uncover key drivers influencing employee turnover. The dataset consists of 1,470 employees with 35 features . The workflow includes data processing (cleaning, feature engineering, and SMOTE resampling), modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and MLP), and evaluation using AUC-ROC. Additionally, for each model, we performed a feature importance analysis to identify the most influential variables affecting attrition.
